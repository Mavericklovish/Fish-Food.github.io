    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Fish Feeding Simulation! In this interactive web experience, you'll dive into a virtual underwater world <br>
        teeming with colorful fishes. Your role is to provide nourishment to these aquatic inhabitants by dropping food into the water.<br> 
        Watch as the fishes gracefully swim towards the food, eagerly gobbling it up.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <h3><li>How to Feed?</li></h3>
    
        <li><u>Click to Feed</u> : Simply click anywhere on the screen to drop food into the water.<br></li>
        <li><u>Watch the Fishes</u> : Observe as the fishes detect the nearest food and swim towards it.<br></li>
        <li><u>Enjoy the Spectacle</u> : Sit back, relax, and enjoy sight of fishes eating food you dropped <br></li>
        in water to satisfy their hunger.

<div id="Inspiration" style="padding:70px">
    <h2>Source of Inspiration</h2>
   <ul>
        <li> Nature documentaries showcasing underwater ecosystems and the behavior of aquatic creatures could have inspired the visual design and realism of the fish and their interactions with food item  </li>
        <li>Artwork and illustrations depicting marine life, underwater scenes, and fantasy creatures could have served as inspiration for the visual design and aesthetics of the fish characters and food items.</li>
        <li>As we delve into the underwater world, we're captivated by the mesmerizing behavior of fishes as they search for food, interact with their environment, and exhibit unique feeding patterns.
        </li>
        <li>Our goal is to recreate the beauty and complexity of aquatic life through interactive graphics, allowing users to connect with nature in a virtual environment and gain a deeper appreciation for the delicate harmony of underwater ecosystems.</li>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
    <h3><li>Following were our objectives at each step when building this project :</li></h3>
        <li>To develop a user-friendly interface using HTML5 canvas.</li>
        <li>Implement interactive functionality so that users can add food at the clicked location.</li>
        <li>Create a visually appealing fish character that moves.</li>
        <li>Design food items with varying appearances to add visual interest and realism to the scene.</li>
        <li>Program the fish to detect the nearest food item and move towards it fluidly.</li>
        <li>Document the codebase with clear comments and explanations to facilitate future maintenance and extension of the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <h3><li>Following are the learnings from this project :</li></h3>
        <li><u>Canvas drawing</u> : Understanding how to use the HTML5 canvas element and drawing basic shapes.</li>
        <li><u>Event handling</u> : Implementing event listeners to detect user input, such as mouse clicks.</li>
        <li><u>Animations and Transformations</u> : Creating smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame and updating canvas elements dynamically.</li>
        <li><u>Food eating</u> : Implementing the logic for fish to detect nearest food and eat it.</li>

<div id="Challenges" style="padding:70px">
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <p><u>Challenge 1</u> :  Less Experience in JavaScript.</p><br>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <u>Situation </u>: The project involves building a complex interactive and functional JavaScript program. However, lacking sufficient expertise in the language posed a challenge in initiating the project.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Task </u>: To understand and implement various JavaScript concepts such as drawing shapes on Canvas, event handling and adding smooth transitions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Action </u>: Learned from online resources such as Youtube tutorials, documentation and help from friends.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Result </u>: Successfully dividing tasks into smaller steps, learn concepts as we progressed using online resources and regularly practice.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <br>
        <p><u>Challenge 2</u> : Implementing Event Listener</p><br>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <u>Situation </u>: While developing the project, one of the tasks involves implementing functionality where food appears on the screen upon mouse-clicking events. This task required a good understanding of event handling.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Task </u>: To implement an event listener for mouse clicks that triggers the appearance of food on the screen when the user interacts with the Canvas template. This involves understanding how to use JavaScript to detect mouse click events and dynamically manipulate the HTML and CSS to display the food item at the clicked location.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Action </u>: Study the concept of event listeners in JavaScript, focusing on how they can be used to detect and respond to user interactions such as mouse clicks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Result </u>: Upon successful implementation of the event listener for mouse clicks, the project is exhibiting the desired behavior: whenever a user clicks anywhere on the screen, food will appear at the clicked location.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <br>
        <p><u>Challenge 3</u> : Achieving smooth animation and design</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <u>Situation </u>: Implementing smooth rendering and animation performance are crucial for delivering a good user experience. However, for achieving this performance on the canvas was challenging, due to limited experience in graphics programming and canvas coding.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Task </u>: To add smooth rendering and animation on the HTML5 canvas. This involved understanding the factors that affect canvas performance and implementing strategies to optimize rendering and animation efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Action </u>: Used efficient function drawing method such as a collectively calling all the functions in 'draw()'. Set up a requestAnimationFrame loop to control the animation frame rate and ensure smooth animation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Result </u>: Upon successful implementation of optimization techniques, the project is exhibiting smooth rendering and animation performance on the HTML5 canvas, providing users with an engaging and responsive visual experience.
